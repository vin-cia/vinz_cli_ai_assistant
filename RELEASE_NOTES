Release Notes
Version 1.1.0

This release introduces several significant improvements and new features to enhance the usability and functionality
of the Vinz CLI AI-Assistant. Below are the detailed changes:

### New Features

    Installation and Uninstallation Commands
        Added a --install argument to allow users to install the script as a normal shell command.
        Added a --uninstall argument to enable users to uninstall the script and clean up related files.
        The script can now be installed to /usr/local/bin and executed with the command v.

    Answers only to pertinent questions
        The tool "should" now provide answers only if they are related to Unix commands and Shell scripting.

    Shebang Line
        Included a shebang line (#!/usr/bin/env python3) to ensure the script uses the appropriate Python interpreter
        found in the user's environment.

    Environment Variable Check
        The script now checks for the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable only when necessary, allowing installation
        and uninstallation to proceed without requiring the API key.

### Improvements

    User Interface Enhancements
        Updated the welcome message to reflect the new command name "v" instead of "vcaa".
        Improved logging and error messages to guide users through installation and uninstallation processes.

    Script Permissions
        The script is made executable during the installation process to allow for seamless execution as a command.

### Bug Fixes

    Permission Handling
        Fixed permission-related issues by suggesting the use of sudo when necessary during installation and uninstallation.

    Robust Error Handling
        Enhanced error handling to provide more informative messages for API errors, rate limits, and unexpected issues.
